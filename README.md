# REST
- Representational State Transfer is a software architecture style consisting of guidelines and best practices for creating scalable web services.
- REST is a coordinated set of constraints applied to the design of components in a distributed hypermedia system that can lead to performant and mainatainable architecture.
- REST has gained widespread acceptance across the web as a simpler alternative to SOAP and WSDL-based web services.
- REST-based web services typically, but not always communicate over Hypertext Transfer Protocol with the same HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) used by web browsers to retrieve web pages and send data to remote servers.
#Architectural Properties
The architectural properties affected by the constraints of the REST architectural style are:
- Performance: component interactions can be the dominant factor in user-percieved performance and network efficiency.
